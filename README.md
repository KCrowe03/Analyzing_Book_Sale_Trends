# Analyzing_Book_Sale_Trends

For the last 10 years I have had a personal goal of reading 200 books per year including Kindle, physical, and audiobooks. As I track my reading, I’ve become more interested in the factors that influence book sales and popularity across different formats. One of the key questions I aim to answer with this project is: Which format (Kindle, physical, audiobook) is more profitable and by how much? As I explored this topic, even more questions emerged, and I hope to continue growing this notebook to follow trends in book sales. This project helps me better understand the publishing industry and allows me to apply the data analysis skills I’ve learned so far. 

This project analyzes trends in book sales across different formats (physical, Kindle, audiobooks) using datasets from Kaggle. It focuses on understanding patterns related to book ratings, reviews, and pricing, to provide insights into the most profitable formats and the impact of book ratings on sales.
